# A user guide to me 👋

Hi! I’m Ignacio, Iñaki, and also Choco. But yeah, you'll probably use Ignacio.

## Things that matter to me

**People first.** My main goal is building a healthy team. I believe that happy, informed, and productive people create beautiful things together. I’ll always try to be kind.

**Autonomy.** I believe that people closest to the problem should make decisions. My job is to set direction and clear the path for you — not make technical calls.

**Small groups.** Peer reviews speed things up. When deciding, I look for someone who disagrees and pressure-test ideas early. I don’t bring decisions to big meetings for consensus. I make them independently and communicate clearly.

**Ownership.** If something lands on my plate, I’ll see it through — not because someone’s watching. I expect the same. If you dodge ownership, chances are I won’t want to work with you.

**Honesty.** I default to openness. No guessing games — ask me anything and you’ll get a straight answer. That includes informal, constant feedback. It might feel rough at times. I say “honestly” way too much — feel free to make fun of that.

**Positivity.** I assume good intent. I try to understand why people act the way they do, instead of labeling behavior as stupid or evil.

**Simplicity.** In architecture, in process, in words.

## Average week

I aim to have a 1:1 every week for at least 30 minutes with my reports. I usually start with [How Are You?](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-update-the-vent-and-the-disaster/)

Don’t wait until our 1:1 for urgent stuff. My days are packed (I hate it too), but if you need me, I’ll make time. If it’s urgent, call or text.

Not every problem needs a meeting. Start async < 3 messages. If it drags on, just call — I’m here to move forward, not get stuck in loops.

I review async comms based on urgency. If you send me a doc without context, I might not read it. I get about one doc a day, so keep it short and clear if you want my input fast.

I try to have a staff meeting with my directs every week.

## Feedback

I’ll do my best to help you perform and feel fulfilled.

I believe constant feedback is key to a healthy, sane relationship. I’ll commit to that. Please do the same. The more often, the better.

Alongside ongoing feedback, we’ll do performance reviews. I expect honest reflection on how you see your own performance, and I’ll always try to support you.

I have flaws (more below). I’ll make mistakes and openly admit them when I see them.

I respond well to feedback — preferably 1:1 and unfiltered.

I regularly do skip-level 1:1s to learn how teams are doing and whether we need to adjust anything.

## Quirks

**I’m an extrovert.** I get energy from passionate people and solving problems with others. Sometimes I get too engaged and neglect things (like our 1:1).

**I try not to dominate meetings.** I hang back to let others speak and be curious. It may seem soft or non-opinionated — I’m not.

**I often work on two extremes:** what can get us fired, and what can make us shine. I over-index on both. Some day-to-day stuff can fall through the cracks.

**I care about people.** Sometimes too much. I’ve made decisions based on how someone would feel and regretted it later. Still working on that balance.

**I try to understand what’s behind opinions.** I think it’s one of my strongest skills — but if you don’t do the same, I’ll probably see you as self-centered.

**Things that trigger me.** Stating opinions as facts. Broad generalizations. Self-centeredness. Recurring victimism.
