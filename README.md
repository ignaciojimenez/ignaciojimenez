# A user guide to me üëã
Hi! I‚Äôm Ignacio, I√±aki, and also Choco. But yeah, you'll probably use Ignacio.

## Things that matter to me
**People first.** My main goal is building a healthy team. I believe happy people create beautiful things together. Without the right people, good ideas are useless. [Jim Collins says](https://www.jimcollins.com/article_topics/articles/first-who.html#:~:text=The%20good%2Dto,people%20is%C2%A0irrelevant.) begin with _who_ rather than _what_, and I agree. The right people will tell you the _what_.

**Autonomy.** I believe that people closest to the problem should make decisions. My job is to help set direction and clear the path for you ‚Äî not make technical calls.

**Small groups.** Peer reviews speed things up. When deciding, I look for people who disagree and pressure-test ideas early. I don‚Äôt bring decisions to big meetings for consensus. I make them independently and try to communicate them clearly and move.

**Ownership.** If something lands on my plate, I‚Äôll see it through. I expect the same from others. If you dodge ownership, chances are I won‚Äôt want to work with you.

**Honesty.** I default to openness. No guessing games ‚Äî ask me anything and you‚Äôll get a straight answer. That includes informal, constant feedback. It might feel rough at times, but I think honesty is a form of pure kindness. I say ‚Äúhonestly‚Äù way too much ‚Äî feel free to make fun of that.

**Positivity.** I assume good intent. I try to understand why people act the way they do and try to help them, instead of labeling behavior as stupid or evil.

**Simplicity.** In architecture, in process, in words.

## Average week
I aim to have a 1:1 every week for at least 30 minutes with my reports. I usually start with [How Are You?](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-update-the-vent-and-the-disaster/). I also try to have a staff meeting with my directs every week.

Don‚Äôt wait until our 1:1 for urgent stuff. My days are packed (I hate it too), but if you need me, I‚Äôll make time. If it‚Äôs urgent, call or text. No matter when that is.

Not every problem needs a meeting. Start async < 3 messages. If it drags on, just call ‚Äî I‚Äôm here to move forward, not get stuck in loops.

I review async comms based on urgency. If you send me a doc without context, I might not read it. I get about one doc a day, so keep it short and clear if you want my input fast.

## Feedback
I‚Äôll do my best to help you perform and feel fulfilled. Please tell me if it's not the case.

I believe constant feedback is key to a healthy, sane relationship. I‚Äôll commit to that. Please do the same. The more often, the better.

Alongside ongoing feedback, we‚Äôll do performance reviews. I expect honest reflection on how you see your own performance with a high bar, and I‚Äôll always try to support you. 

I have flaws (more below). I‚Äôll make mistakes and openly admit them when I see them.

I respond well to feedback ‚Äî preferably 1:1 and unfiltered.

I regularly do skip-level 1:1s to learn how teams are doing and whether we need to adjust anything.

## Quirks
**I‚Äôm an extrovert.** I get energy from passionate people and solving problems with others. Sometimes I get too engaged in it and unfortunately neglect things (like our 1:1).

**I try not to dominate meetings.** I hang back to let others speak and be curious. It may seem soft or non-opinionated ‚Äî I don't think I am. If I'm getting frustrated with the conversation I might come in too directive. Give me feedback about this please.

**I often work on two extremes:** what can get us fired, and what can make us shine. I over-index on both. [4DX](https://www.franklincovey.com/courses/the-4-disciplines/discipline-1-wildy-important/) proposes a similar framework which I really like. Some day-to-day stuff can fall through the cracks because of this, keep me sharp! 

**I care about people.** Sometimes too much. I‚Äôve made decisions based on how someone would feel and regretted it later. Sometimes not. Still working on that balance.

**I try to understand what‚Äôs behind opinions.** I think it‚Äôs one of my strongest skills that helps me read between the lines. If you don‚Äôt try your best to do it too, I‚Äôll probably see you as self-centered and that might be unfair.

**Things that trigger me.** Stating opinions as facts. Broad generalizations. Self-centeredness. Recurring victimism. Lack of situational awareness.
