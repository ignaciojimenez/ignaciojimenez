Hi! I‚Äôm Ignacio, I√±aki, Nacho, and also Choco. But you'll probably use Ignacio. Born 1981 in the [Canary Islands (Spain)](https://g.co/kgs/QUGaioD).

## Things that matter to me
**People first.** My main goal is building a healthy team. I believe happy people create beautiful things together. Without the right people, good ideas are useless. As [Jim Collins says](https://www.jimcollins.com/article_topics/articles/first-who.html#:~:text=The%20good%2Dto,people%20is%C2%A0irrelevant.) _begin with who rather than what_. The right people will tell you the _what_.

**Autonomy.** I believe that people closest to the problem should make decisions. My job is to help set direction and clear the path, not make technical calls unless required.

**Small groups.** Peer reviews speed things up. When deciding, I look for people who disagree and pressure-test ideas early. I don‚Äôt bring decisions to big meetings for consensus. I make them independently, try to communicate them clearly and move. Please don't wait!

**Ownership.** If something lands on my plate, I‚Äôll figure out how to make it happen. I expect the same from others. If you dodge ownership, chances are I won‚Äôt want to work with you.

**Honesty.** I default to openness. No guessing games, ask me anything and you‚Äôll get a straight answer. That includes informal, constant feedback. It might feel rough at times, but I think honesty is a form of kindness. And I say ‚Äúhonestly‚Äù way too much ‚Äî feel free to make fun of that :)

**Positivity.** I assume good intent. I try to understand why people act the way they do and try to help them, instead of labeling behavior as stupid or evil. If I identify bad intent or selfish behaviour, we'll likely have a problem.

**Simplicity.** In architecture, in process, in words.

## Communication
I usually start a conversation with [How Are You?](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-update-the-vent-and-the-disaster/).

My days are packed (I hate it too), but if you need me for something urgent, I‚Äôll make time. Just reach out directly.

Not every problem needs a meeting. Start async < 3 messages. If it drags on, just call ‚Äî I‚Äôm here to move forward, not get stuck in endless conversations.

I review async comms based on urgency. If you send me a doc without context, I might not read it. I get about one doc a day, so keep it short and clear if you want my input fast.

## Feedback
I‚Äôll do my best to help you perform and feel fulfilled. Please tell me if it's not the case.

I believe constant feedback is key to a healthy, sane relationship. I‚Äôll commit to that. Please do the same. The more often, the better.

I have flaws (more below). I‚Äôll make mistakes and I'll try to openly admit them when I see them.

I respond well to feedback ‚Äî preferably direct and unfiltered.

## Quirks
**I‚Äôm an extrovert.** I get energy from passionate people and solving problems with others. Sometimes I get too engaged in it and unfortunately neglect other things.

**I try not to dominate meetings.** I hang back to let others speak and be curious. It may seem soft or non-opinionated. But also, if I'm getting frustrated with the conversation I might come in too directive. Give me feedback about this please.

**I often work on two extremes:** what can get us fired, and what can make us shine. I over-index on both. [4DX](https://www.franklincovey.com/courses/the-4-disciplines/discipline-1-wildy-important/) proposes somewhat a similar framework to focus which I really like. Because of this, day-to-day stuff can fall through the cracks, keep me sharp!

**I care about people.** Sometimes too much. I‚Äôve made decisions based on how someone would feel and regretted it later. Still working on that balance.

**I just care too much.** And I struggle to say no to people that need help, which makes me be involved in more things than I can handle in a day and makes me underdeliver and overwork. Please tell me to stop doing this.

**I try to understand what‚Äôs behind opinions.** If I perceive that you don't try to understand others I‚Äôll probably think of you as self-centered and that might be unfair. This is a bias I know I have.

**Things that trigger me.** Stating opinions as facts. Broad generalizations. Self-centeredness. Recurring victimism. Lack of situational awareness.

**I have too many hobbies.** Tech, too many sports, film photograhpy, Guitars and all types of music. More about me at [ignacio.systems](https://ignacio.systems/)
